Hello, everyone! 

My name is Michael Ramirez. I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My research interests focus broadly on substance use disorder, overdose prevention, and machine learning to predict adverse health outcomes among people who inject drugs. At the moment, I am working on a project meant to identify predictors of future overdose among people who inject drugs in Baltimore, MD.
